# FastAPI_tutorial

FastAPI is only for taking in requests and giving responses with CRUD operations. So we will be using 'uvicorn' for hosting a webserver where our API inputs and outputs will be visible.  
To run the file via uvicorn, execute the command `uvicorn <filename_of_fastAPI>:app --reload` on terminal (file_name is without '.py' extension).
